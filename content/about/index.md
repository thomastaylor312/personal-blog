## Bio of Taylor

![Taylor Thomas](/images/Headshot-small.jpg)

I'm Taylor Thomas, a software engineer based in the Salt Lake City area in the state of Utah, USA. I have a long background in Open Source software development, particularly around the CNCF landscape (think Kubernetes if you aren't familiar). I was a long time [Helm](https://helm.sh) maintainer and was responsible for writing a decent chunk of Helm 3 along with some of my fellow maintainers. I also spent a while creating Kubernetes platforms at Intel, Nike, and Microsoft. I'm currently heavily involved in the WebAssembly (Wasm) ecosystem, particularly around WASI and the Component Model. I maintain several projects there and am an Org Maintainer for the [wasmCloud](https://wasmcloud.com) project.

This site is my personal blog (though obviously things will bleed over from some of the stuff I do at work), mainly focused around tech, though I might occasionally take some detours into other nerdy things and hobbies. I do like writing, but am definitely sporadic, so don't expect any sort of cadence.
